// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

void main() {
  testWidgets('App loads attendance screen', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Note: Full app testing requires Hive initialization and dependency injection
    // This is a placeholder test. For full integration testing, use integration_test/
    expect(true, true);
